June 2016 - Chicago User Observation
===================  
At the Write/Speak/Code conference held in Chicago, IL, a team member attended the coding portion of the conference to observe attendees interacting with the Draft Web Design Standards. These attendees were participating in their very first open source project and were prime candidates to observe to understand user on-boarding.

##Set Up
Attendees of the conference were given the choice of open source project they would like to work on as their first project. Some broke up in pairs to work on similar tasks, others worked solo.

As the attendees began to work on the Draft Web Design Standards, we would walk around and listen any issues or concerns they had. If anything came up of note, e.g. issues setting up the project, the team would engage with probing questions to learn more about how the issue occurred and how the attendee was trying to resolve the issue.

#observations
Here are the top observations coming out of the research:

##Initial setup is daunting
* "I can't find all of the dependencies though?"
* The site has a lot of great information on how to get started, but the repo doesn't effectively point people to the site. We should assume the repo is the initial point of contact with the project.
* Attendee was getting initial fails when setting up the project because existing development environment didn't have an updated set up.
* Some jargon isn't known for new contributors such as NPM.
* Clearly separate individual steps and combo steps to guide people through the setup.

##Locating files is confusing
* Multiple files with the same name can show up when doing a search. E.g. style.css
* asd

##Instructions are helpful, but lacking in some areas
* "Should we download the whole repo?"
  * Instructions should be goal oriented. What does the use want to do? Here's how...
* New contributors may need additional guidance on how to replicate bug issues so they can attempt a solution.
* Some of the instructions don't match the headlines when discussing npm setup.
* Some attendees had to use google and locate outside instructions for setting up node, especially on window machines.

* Clear channel to reach the core team is needed to address initial questions.
* Provide additional context around the Pull Request template to allow novice contributors to better create Pull Requests.

##Finding Ways to Contribute
* "Are things prioritized at all?"
  * Contributors need to be pointed to the filters and taught how to use them
  * "How does assignments work? Can I assign something to myself?"
* "How do I get started?"
* Is it possible to provide folks with the source design files to make creating contribution easier?
* What frameworks are acceptable when creating contributions to the site or the draft standards?
* If an issue is centered around a visual problem, we should ensure that annotations are included to help contributions understand what the real problem is.

##Meaningful Quotes
* "I'll try not to mess anything up..."
* "Do I fork it to my own personal repo?"
