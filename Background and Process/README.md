##Draft Wed Design Standards Background
Past research has been performed with both designers and developers looking to use the draft web design standards. In the future, additional research will be conducted to ensure that the draft standards are user friendly for anyone looking to implement them.

One area of research that is planned and will need to be put into place is validating that the various components of the draft standards are seen as usable by a variety of users, including those that are hard to serve. This includes accessibility testing from a design point of view and overall digital literacy.
